Cartograph
A project by Campbell Glass

Cartograph is a project that randomly generates topographic maps.
This work was motivated by a lack of inspiration: I wanted to make
somewhat realistic maps for Dungeons and Dragons, but was frustrated
by the classic cartographer's block. This project serves as a way to
overcome this obstacle and provide a resource for future mapmaking.
It was also fun to code, and provides a lot of room for improvement,
optimization, and exploration.
